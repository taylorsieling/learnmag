Before starting my project, the thought of coding my own CLI was daunting, to say the least. Like a true D&D fan, I decided to approach the journey like a campaign. I was a character with strengths and weaknesses, setting out on an adventure, where I would no doubt encounter many enemies (and hopefully some friends). Appropriately, I decided to use a D&D 5e API for my project. Using data that I was both passionate about and familiar with helped so much when it came to the actual coding. 

I started out by following Flatiron examples pretty closely. I set up Spell and CharacterClass models that allowed users to search for spell lists by class. From there, users can view specific casting details by selecting a spell from the list. I started with just a few spell specifics, but ended up adding more information as I went along.

The hardest part of the project was deciding the scope of the program. The API contained a lot of data and I did a lot of coding, deleting, and commenting out before I settled on how I would search for and display the data. I originally coded two API pulls. Then, I decided to add a third in order to print additional information. However, after hours of errors and an enlightening meeting with my Cohort Lead, I decided to go back down to two. The entire process really helped me solidify my understanding of object-orientation by deciding how I wanted my models to work together. 

I cannot state enough how much I thoroughly enjoyed coding this project. Although there were indeed enemies (looking at you syntax errors), I feel incredibly accomplished and ready to take on the next program module. Let it be all Nat 20s here on out.
