For most of my life, I have struggled with determining my ultimate career goal. I grew up as a *Gifted & Talented* kid - I was smart, self-disciplined, and generally good at a lot of things. But as they say, "jack of all trades, master of none..." 

I never had that *one thing* that I was really good at, or a particular passion that drove me in a singular direction. Every decision that I made in high school and college just felt like throwing darts at a board of things that I just *kind of* liked. And, in the end, nothing really stuck.

After multiple degree changes in college (and many the breakdown), I ended up with a Bachelor’s Degree in Hospitality Administration. What do you do with a degree in Hospitality Administration? Good question. I ended up getting a job as a program coordinator at a medical school - I plan student events and activities and advise programs and organizations.

Cut to a few months ago - I was completmplating the fact that I hit my four-year work anniversary, with no signs of upwards mobility and a total lack of direction for the rest of my life. Despite my efforts to feel motivated and positive, I was facing intense burnout and a lot of anxiety about the future. I was ranting to my co-worker (and very good friend) about my woes when she interrupted me with a "Oh that reminds me - I saw a Tik Tok the other day that totally reminded me of you." 

She showed me a video of a girl talking about her success after completing the Flatiron Software Engineering Bootcamp. And, everything kind of clicked into place.

I love coding. Managing the front end of our department website and coding our weekly student e-newsletter are my favorite parts of my job. I love problem-solving, and troubleshooting, and debugging. I love how coding combines logic and mathematics with infinite creativity. 

After some research and rearranging of my personal budget, here I am! It feels good to be a student of something that I really enjoy and it feels good to have a direction that I am passionate about. The First Mile has been tough. My study skills are rusty and I’ve had to learn to pace myself appropriately. But, it already feels totally worth it. 

Here’s to becoming a *Master of One*!
